# npm has locked me out

I no longer have access to the NPM account that this package was published to. This package was originally published under the `arkanciscan` user which I still have access to, but NPM insists that they can't give me access to the `jessehattabaugh` user without a recovery code, or password that I lost long ago. 

They still link to this repository though so I'll have to think of something funny to put here.
